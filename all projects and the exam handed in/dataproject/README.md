Our project is titled **Impact of GDP per capita on employment in worldwide agriculture over the past 30 years** where we examine the impact of GDP per capita on the % of people employed in agriculture for all countries in the world. We then conduct further analysis by calculating the arable land per person employed in agriculture for the top ten largest countries in the world (by total arable land) and compare how this has evolved as the GDP per capita has increased/decreased over time providing interpretation as to why the plotted relationships do exist.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

All of our datatsets are read in through the World Bank API and adapted into our .ipynb file. 

**Dependencies:** Standard Anaconda Python 3 installation

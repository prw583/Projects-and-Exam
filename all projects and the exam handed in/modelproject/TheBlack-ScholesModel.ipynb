    "The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model for pricing European-style options. It's widely used in the financial industry, and it has significantly impacted the field of financial economics. The model assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion, and it derives a closed-form solution for the price of said asset. It provides a theoretical estimate of the value of a call or put option based on the following parameters:\n",

    "Varying the strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and sigma can all affect the option prices according to the Black-Scholes model in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strike price (K)**: The strike price is the price at which the option can be exercised. Increasing the strike price of a call option, for example, means the underlying asset must appreciate more to become profitable for the option holder. Thus, increasing the strike price of a call option (holding all else constant) will generally decrease its price, and vice versa for a put option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time to maturity (T)**: The time to maturity is the amount of time remaining until the option contract expires. All else being equal, an option with a longer time to maturity has a higher chance of becoming profitable, as there is more time for the underlying asset to move in the desired direction. Thus an increase in time to maturity will increase the price of both call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk-free rate (r)**: The risk-free rate is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. It is the rate at which an investor can earn money with certainty, and is typically tied to the yield on government bonds/treasuries. The risk-free rate is used in the Black-Scholes model to discount the expected future payoff of the option to its present value. An increase in the risk-free rate increases the discount rate, which reduces the present value of the expected future payoff. Thus, an increase in the risk-free rate will decrease the price of both call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volatility (sigma)**: Volatility measures the degree of variation of a financial asset's price over time. The Black-Scholes model assumes that the volatility of the underlying asset is constant over time. An increase in volatility increases the expected range of future prices for the underlying asset, and thus increases the probability that the option will be exercised profitably. Thus, all else being equal, an increase in volatility will increase the price of both call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the slider to adjust multiple variables at a time, we can get a deeper understanding of how option prices vary when multiple variables increase/decrease simultaneously.\n"

    "In the standard Black & Scholes model we have covered above, dividends are assumed to be zero and are not incorporated into the pricing of options. However, we can extend on this basic model by accomodating for dividends and seeing how this change affects the prices of both call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of dividends, the drift rate is adjusted to reflect the present value of future dividends. Specifically, the drift rate becomes:\n",

    "where $r$ is the risk-free interest rate and $q$ is the continuous dividend yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dividends are included, the Black-Scholes model assumes that the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion with the drift rate adjusted by the dividend yield. \n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the dividend yield, q, appears in the formula for $d1$ and in the term $e^{-qT}$, which adjusts the stock price for the present value of the dividends.

    "There are several possible more complex extensions to the Black-Scholes model which are briefly described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)** Stochastic volatility models: These models assume that the volatility of the underlying asset is not constant but rather follows a stochastic process. The most famous example of this is the Heston model, which is widely used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii)** Jump-diffusion models: These models allow for sudden, large movements in the underlying asset price, known as jumps which may be as a result of certain macro shocks. They are useful for pricing options on assets with fat-tailed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(iii)** Interest rate models: These models take into account the fact that interest rates are not constant but rather follow a stochastic process. One well-known example is the Hull-White model that calculates the price of a derivative security as a function of the entire yield curve rather than a single rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(iv)** American options: The Black-Scholes model assumes that options can only be exercised at expiration. In reality, most options are American-style, which means they can be exercised at any time before expiration. Pricing American options requires the use of numerical methods, such as the binomial tree or Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(v)** Path-dependent options: The Black-Scholes model assumes that the payoff of an option depends only on the value of the underlying asset at expiration. Path-dependent options, such as Asian options or barrier options, have payoffs that depend on the path of the underlying asset during the life of the option. Pricing these options requires more sophisticated models and numerical methods."

    "he Black-Scholes model is an important model for pricing options, and it has been widely used by traders and investors for decades, but it is not without its drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaways from using the Black-Scholes model in options pricing are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model provides a theoretical framework for determining the fair price of European options, which are options that can only be exercised at the expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The model assumes that the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion and that the option price is a function of five variables: the current stock price, the strike price, the time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of the stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Black-Scholes model assumes that the market is efficient and that all relevant information is already incorporated into the stock price. Therefore, it assumes that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The model provides insights into the relationship between option prices and the underlying asset price, time to expiration, and volatility. For example, the price of a call option increases as the stock price increases, the time to expiration increases, or the volatility increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The model has limitations and assumptions that may not hold in the real world, such as the assumption of constant volatility, the assumption of continuous trading, and the assumption of no transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the limitations posed by the model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assumptions: The model relies on several assumptions, such as constant volatility, no dividends (base model), efficient markets, and risk-free interest rates. In reality, these assumptions may not always hold true, and this can lead to inaccuracies in the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limited applicability: The model is most suitable for European-style options, which can only be exercised at expiration. It is less effective for American-style options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Volatility: While the Black-Scholes model assumes constant volatility, volatility in real markets can vary significantly. This can lead to discrepancies between the model's predictions and actual market prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Other factors: The model does not take into account other factors that can affect option prices, such as market liquidity, trading volume, and changes in supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base model does not incorporate dividends, but through our extension we are able to work around this limitation and see how options prices change when a company issues dividends. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, The Black-Scholes model is an elegant model, but it does not perform very well in practice, given the uncertain nature of stock movement, shocks to the macroeconomic enviornment and a variety of other factors that influence stock behaviour and investor sentiment.\n",

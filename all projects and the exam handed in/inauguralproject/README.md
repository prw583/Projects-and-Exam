In this project we examine how both males and females chose their time whether it be working from home or working in the market, and how this varies based on the relative wage ratio. 

Notably, we examine the effect of varying the household production parameters alpha and sigma and evaluating the impact they have on the ratio of hours worked at home by males and females and the wage ratio. We create plots to illustrate these effects in both a discrete and continous model setting, with varying females wages and a constant male wage variable.

We likewise run a regression analysis and complete an optimization problem to find the optimal values of alpha and sigma so our data fits the model.

Finally, we suggest an extension of the model in which we hold the household production parameter alpha constant and examine the effect this has on the vale of sigma, and whether this helps match the data.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
